## Course Completions



### Completed Coursera Courses

**Course 1: Peer-to-Peer Protocols and Local Area Networks 
- **Provider:** University of Colorado System
- **Email:** oindri.aurunima.sarker@g.bracu.ac.bd
- **Course URL:** https://www.coursera.org/learn/peer-to-peer-protocols-local-area-networks
- **Relevance to CSE707:** This course provides core understanding of how P2P protocols like BitTorrent organize peers, share files, and manage network traffic which is directly relevant to my project. Also this course focuses on LAN fundamentals, distributed architectures, covering synchronization, resource sharing, and system design which align directly with our course material.

**Course 2: Introduction to High-Performance and Parallel Computing - University of Colorado Boulder**
- **Provider:** University of Colorado Boulder
- **Email:** oindri.aurunima.sarker@g.bracu.ac.bd
- **Course URL:** https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-high-performance-computing/
- **Relevance to CSE707:** This course expands our learning by focusing on performance and scalability in distributed systems. It explores distributed memory structures, parallel processing models, and methods for analyzing system performance, going deeper than the basic concepts we studied earlier. These abilities are crucial for building and optimizing effective distributed computing solutions.



### Completed YouTube Videos

**MIT 6.824/6.5840 Distributed Systems Lecture Series**
- **Video URL**: https://www.youtube.com/@6.824
- **Instructor**: Professor Robert Morris (MIT PDOS Lab)
- **Relevance to CSE707**: This lecture series introduces key topics in distributed systems such as MapReduce, the Raft consensus protocol, fault tolerance, replication methods, and consistency models. It closely matches our coursework on distributed architectures and resilient system design, while offering complementary viewpoints on these core ideas.

**Martin Kleppmann - Cambridge Distributed Systems Course**
- **Provider**: University of Cambridge
- **Website**: https://www.distributedsystemscourse.com/
- **Video URL**: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOE1GTZ5ouRPbpTnrZ3Wqjamfwn_Q5Y9A
- **Topics**: System models, Byzantine faults, logical time, broadcast protocols, consensus algorithms (Raft), replica consistency, two-phase commit, case studies on Google Spanner
- **Relevance to CSE707**: This course connects theoretical concepts of distributed systems with hands-on applications, focusing on consensus protocols, replication techniques, and design patterns. It is vital for grasping scalable distributed architectures and grounds theoretical ideas in real-world practice.
